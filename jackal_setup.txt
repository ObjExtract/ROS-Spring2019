Term 1:

ssh -X  
	gedit ~/.bashrc

add the following line to the end of the file (no tabs)
	export ROS_HOSTNAME=

In terminal run:

	cd catkin_ws/src
	git clone -b kinetic-devel https://github.com/jackal/jackal.git
	git clone -b kinetic-devel https://github.com/jackal/jackal_simulator.git
	cd ..
	catkin_make

We need to make sure the laserscan topic is called /scan
	cd ~/catkin_ws/src/jackal/jackal_navigation/launch/include
	gedit gmapping.launch
replace front/scan with /scan #Then save file
	gedit amcl.launch
replace front/scan with /scan #Then save file
	cd /home/nvidia/catkin_ws/src/jackal/jackal_navigation/params
	gedit costmap_common_params.yaml
replace front_laser with laser #Then save file
replace front/scan with /scan #Then save file
	

Term 2:

On remote computer: 
	gedit ~/.bashrc

add the following two lines to the end of the file (no tabs)
	export ROS_HOSTNAME=.local #your desktop name
        ROS_MASTER_URI=http://.local:11311

In terminal run:

	sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-jackal-simulator ros-kinetic-jackal-desktop
	cd catkin_ws/src
	git clone -b kinetic-devel https://github.com/jackal/jackal.git

	cd ..
	catkin_make
