2: Inspecting ROS at runtime


Open Firefox

Navigate to http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials/Introduction%20to%20tf

Skip 1. Set Up the Demo

Work through 2. Running the Demo - 4.2 Using rqt_tf_tree

In a new terminal:
Verify the /turtle1_tf_broadcaster and /turtle2_tf_broadcaster are active nodes by
calling `rosnode list`

Test the connection to an active node by calling `rosnode ping [node]`

View the active topics by running `rostopic list`

Display the publishing rates of the two broadcasters by calling `rostopic hz` 
Compare to the average rates shown in the rqt_tf_tree. Which are greater? Why?

Continue working through the tf Tutorials and finish with the tf and Time tutorials

roscd to the turtle_tf package and open the turtle_demo.launch file

Verify the turtle1_tf_broadcaster and turtle2_tf_broadcaster are listed as nodes in the launch file

Which parameters are declared in the launch file? What are their values?

Open the package.xml, which packages does turtle_tf depend on at runtime?
