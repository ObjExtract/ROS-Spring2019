Work through 2. Running the Demo - 4.2 Using rqt_tf_tree

In a new terminal:
Verify the /turtle1_tf_broadcaster and /turtle2_tf_broadcaster are active nodes by
calling `rosnode list`

Display the publishing rates of the two broadcasters by calling `rostopic hz` 
Compare to the average rates shown in the rqt_tf_tree. Which are greater? Why?
